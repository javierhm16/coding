                    may be related to your location. Your carrier may charge standard data and other fees for use of
                    Push Messages, and these fees may appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid
                    balance. Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Push Messages and certain Push Messages may
                    be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding
                    these issues. You may discontinue Push Messages in your device’s or the App’s settings or by
                    deleting the App. We may collect information related to your use of Push Messages. If you have
                    registered for Push Messages, you agree to notify us of any changes to your mobile number, as
                    applicable, and update your account on the App to reflect this change. </p>

                <p _ngcontent-lnk-c35=""> The Online Time Reporting and Approval System is an online tool that allows
                    Seekmate’s employees, independent contractors, and business clients to enter, review, and approve
                    time
                    reports (the “System”). “Employee” refers to users of the System who are employed by Seekmate. The
                    term “Independent Contractor” refers to users of the System who are working as independent
                    contractors through Seekmate. Within this section entitled “ONLINE TIME REPORTING AND APPROVAL
                    SYSTEM,” the term “Customer” refers to users of the System who are business clients of Seekmate. If
                    you are not an authorized Employee, Independent Contractor, or Customer in the United States, please
                    do not use the System. Unauthorized access or usage is strictly prohibited, and violators are
                    subject to civil liabilities and criminal prosecution. </p>

                    information or enter new direct deposit information. You may make changes to your default payment
                    method in the App by going to the Account Information section of the My Account menu. You are
                    responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to Seekmate

                    and hours entered on the time report through the System are correct, complete, and were worked by
                    you. You understand that a misstatement of fact may cause you to lose your employment or contract
